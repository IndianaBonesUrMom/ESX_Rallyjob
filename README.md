Couldn't find any Rally driver jobs on the internet so I made this last night. 
It's been on my server for a day now and nobody has complained about bugs so far.

Features:  
1. Paychecks according to lap-time. Paycheck tiers: Gold (track record), Silver, Bronze and failure.
2. Laptimes are auto-maintained and always dictated by the current lap record.  Getting good paychecks gets harder and harder when time goes by.

How to install:

If you don't know how to install this you probably shouldn't be hosting a server anyways. 
The Server list is already full of pasta servers anyways. And the funny thing is, people actually do prefer pasta servers.
More pasta = more players.
