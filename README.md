Couldn't find any Rally driver jobs on the internet so I made this last night. 
Please report any bugs so I can fix them asap.  Discord.me/Napapiiri

Features:  
1. Paychecks according to lap-time. Paycheck tiers: Gold (track record), Silver, Bronze and failure.
2. Laptimes are dictated by the current lap record. Getting a good paychecks gets harder and harder when time goes by. You can edit the multipliers for silver and bronze in config.lua.
3. Name of the track record holder is displayed when player enters a new race.  With 30 seconds of intense thinking and 65 IQ I couldn't find a way to get RP name without SQL. Due to this fact Steam name is displayed.  If you are willing to fuck your server in the ass, feel free to add that extra SQL lookup.

How to install:

If you don't know how to install this you probably shouldn't be hosting a server anyways. 
The Server list is already full of pasta servers. And the funny thing is, people actually do prefer pasta servers.
More pasta = more players.
